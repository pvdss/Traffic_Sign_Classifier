Overview
---
This project uses deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, we will then try out our model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.
